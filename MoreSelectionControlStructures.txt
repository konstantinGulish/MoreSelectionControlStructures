PROGRAM1 (Read and sort letters):

ALGORITHM:
Program receives three letters, sorts them in the assending order, and outputs the sorted letters to the screen
INPUTS
letterOne, letterTwo, letterThree
PROCESSING STEPS
receive letterOne, letterTwo, letterThree
compare letter one to letter two and letter three
compare letter two to letter one and letter three
compare letter three to letter one and letter two
OUTPUTS

_______________

PSEUDOCODE:

Prompt user for letterOne
Get letterOne
Prompt user for letterTwo
Get letterTwo
Prompt user for letterThree
Get letterThree
IF letterOne < letterTwo and letterOne < letterThree
THEN
Place letter one first
ELSE IF letterTwo < letterOne and letterTwo < letterThree
THEN
Place letterTwo first
ELSE
Place letterThree first
ENDIF
IF letterOne > letterTwo and letterOne < letterThree
THEN
Place letterOne second
ELSE IF letterTwo > letterOne and letterTwo < letterThree
THEN
Place letterTwo second
ELSE
Place letterThree second
ENDIF
IF letterOne > letterTwo and letterOne > letterThree
THEN
Place letterOne third
ELSE IF letterTwo > letterOne and letterTwo > letterThree
THEN
Place letterTwo third
ELSE
Place letterThree third
ENDIF
Display the sorted letters to the screen

PROGRAM2 (Process customer record):

ALGORITHM:
Program receives a customer's name, a purchase amount, and a tax code and then computes the sales tax and the total amount due,and print the customer’s name, purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.
INPUTS
customerName, purchaseAmount, taxCode
PROCESSING STEPS
receive customerName, purchaseAmount, taxCode
If taxCode is 0, assign salesTax to be 0
If taxcode is 1, assign salesTax to be purchaseAmount times 0.03
If taxcode is 2, assign salesTax to be purchaseAmount times 0.05
If taxcode is 3, assign salesTax to be purchaseAmount times 0.07
Calculate totalAmount = purchaseAmount plus salesTax

OUTPUTS
display customerName, purchaseAmount, salesTax, and totalAmount
_______________

PSEUDOCODE:

Prompt user for customerName
Get customerName
Prompt user for purchaseAmount
Get purchaseAmount
Prompt user for taxCode
Get taxCode
IF taxCode = 0
THEN
salesTax = 0
ELSE IF taxCode = 1
THEN
salesTax = purchaseAmount * 0.03
ELSE IF taxCode = 2
THEN
salesTax = purchaseAmount * 0.05
ELSE IF taxCode = 3
THEN
salesTax = purchaseAmount * 0.07
ENDIF
Calculate totalAmount = purchaseAmount + salesTax
Displayisplay customerName, purchaseAmount, salesTax, and totalAmount

PROGRAM3 (Calculate employee's pay):

ALGORITHM:
Program receives an nput data and error message in a week. It then validates the pay rate field and the hours worked field and, if valid, computes the employee’s weekly pay and then prints it and the input data to the screen.
INPUTS
employeeNumber, payRate, numberOfHours
PROCESSING STEPS
receive employeeNumber, payRate, numberOfHours
If numberOfHours is greater then 60, display input data and error message
If payRate is greater than 25, display nput data and error message
Otherwise, if the numberOfHours is less than 35, calculate weeklyPay by multiplying hoursWorked by payRate
Otherwise, calculate weeklyPay by multiplying 35 by payRate and adding remaining hours multiplied by payRate by 1.5
OUTPUTS
display input data and weeklyPay to the screen
_______________

PSEUDOCODE:

Prompt user for employeeNumber
Get employeeNumber
Prompt user for payRate
Get payRate
Prompt user for numberOfHours
Get numberOfHours
IF numberOfHours > 60
THEN
Display employeeNumber, payRate, numberOfHours and error message
ELSE IF payRate > 25
THEN
Display employeeNumber, payRate, numberOfHours and error message
ELSE
IF numberOfHours < 30
THEN
weeklyPay = payRate * numberOfHours
ELSE
weeklyPay = payRate * 35 + ((payRate * 1.5)* (numberOfHours-35))
ENDIF
Display employeeNumber, payRate, numberOfHours, and weeklyPay
